# InstaBot
This is project involving web scraping done on the instagram site using Selenium and Beautiful Soup Library.There are two parts of the small projects which involve doing different taks which are listed in both the project folders.

Little intro to the libraries.

###### Selenium
Selenium: Selenium Python bindings provide a convenient API to access Selenium Web Driver like Firefox, Chrome, etc.

What is webdriver?
Selenium WebDriver is an automation testing tool. When I say automation, it means it automates test scripts written in Selenium.

Webdriver for Google Chrome can be downloaded from  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads .
Webdriver for FireFox can be downloaded from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases . 

Selenium library can be downloaded by following methods:
- pip install selenium
- conda install -c conda-forge selenium (For Anaconda)


###### Beautiful Soup

Beautiful Soup is a Python library for getting data out of HTML, XML, and other markup languages. Say youâ€™ve found some webpages that display data relevant to your research, such as date or address information, but that do not provide any way of downloading the data directly. Beautiful Soup helps you pull particular content from a webpage, remove the HTML markup, and save the information. It is a tool for web scraping that helps you clean up and parse the documents you have pulled down from the web.

Beautiful Soup libarary can be downloaded by following methods:
- pip install beautifulsoup4
- conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4 ( For Anaconda)
